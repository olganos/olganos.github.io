            Hello! I am Sam. I am the youngest kitten here and I am an only male. I am curious, active and affectionate.
            I want to play with other cats, but they are older and they want to lie on sun as Mayka or play alone as Rusya with her candy wrapper.
            Sometimes they play with me, but it seems they are scared of me. I don't know why. When I bite someone, my mum say stop biting. I have to stop,
            because I guess that it can be painful.
        </p>
        <div class="text-center">
            <img alt="Sam" src="/sam1.jpg" class="rounded mx-auto d-block mb-3 img-fluid" width="600" height="355" />
        </div>
        <p>
            I love play with my owner, because she play with me actively and I run a lot and jump highly. I like my robber disk,
            I even take it in our bed, but mum doesn't like to play in the bed.
        </p>
        <p>
            I hate when she takes me and when she combs me. I start biting and she says that I am a bad boy. However she doesn't offense, because she knows that I
            don't want to do harm, I just strong and active. She likes to pet me and I like too. I even can forget that she is not a cat and start
            licking her and she laughs and says that I am like her son. May be it is true, I don't know, but I heard that she fed me by milk
            when I was a tiny kitten.
            I am a little hesitate to lick my mum and go to lick Rusya. I think she likes it because she licks me too.
        </p>
        <div class="text-center">
            <img alt="Sam" src="/sam2.jpg" class="rounded mx-auto d-block mb-3 img-fluid" width="600" height="427" />
        </div>
        <p>
            I like to knew something new and I like to visit our neighbor, as Rusya. Before the quarantine I could go out and I could sniff the smells
            from my owner when she returned from her office. Hope we will return to the normal time soon.
        </p>
        <p>
            I like eating and try new food. When my owner is cooking I go to a kitchen and sniff the new smells and even ask to try something.
            She allows me to try if the food is not harmful for me. Today I tried a boiled carrot and I liked it. Nevertheless, I prefer cucumbers and kitten food.
        </p>
