            Hello! I am Sam. I am the youngest kitten here and I am the only male. I am curious, active and affectionate.
            I want to play with the other cats, but they are older and they want to lay in the sun like Mayka or play alone like Rusya with her candy wrapper.
            Sometimes they play with me, but it seems they are scared of me. I don't know why. When I bite someone, my mum tells me not to. I have to stop,
            because I guess that it can be painful.
        </p>
        <div class="text-center">
            <img alt="Sam" src="/sam1.jpg" class="rounded mx-auto d-block mb-3 img-fluid" width="600" height="355" />
        </div>
        <p>
            I love playing with my owner, because she plays with me actively and I run a lot and jump high. I like my rubber disk,
            I even take it to our bed, but mum doesn't like me playing in bed.
        </p>
        <p>
            I hate when she holds me and when she brushes me. I start biting and she says that I am a bad boy. However she doesn't mean it, because she knows that I
            don't want to do harm, I am  just strong and active. She likes to pet me and I like it too. I can even forget that she is not a cat and start
            licking her and she laughs and says that I am like her son. Maybe it is true, I don't know, but I heard that she bottle-fed me when I was a tiny kitten.
            I am a little hesitant to lick my mum and go to lick Rusya. I think she likes it because she licks me too.
        </p>
        <div class="text-center">
            <img alt="Sam" src="/sam2.jpg" class="rounded mx-auto d-block mb-3 img-fluid" width="600" height="427" />
        </div>
        <p>
            I like to know something new and I like to visit our neighbor, like Rusya. Before the quarantine I could go out and I could sniff the smells
            on my owner when she returned from her office. Hopefully we will return to normal soon.
        </p>
        <p>
            I like eating and trying new food. When my owner is cooking I go to the kitchen and sniff the new smells and even ask to try something.
            She allows me to try if the food is not harmful for me. Today I tried a boiled carrot and I liked it. Nevertheless, I prefer cucumbers and kitten food.
        </p>
