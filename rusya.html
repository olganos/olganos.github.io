            Hello! I am Rusya and I love people, animals and new things.
            When someone comes in, I go to check who is there. I am so curious that I love go out
            and visiting our neighbor. I am even not afraid of her dog.
        </p>

            Two other cats who live with us, are strange. Mayka doesn't like to play. Sometimes we try, but
            our owner stops us, because she thinks that we are fighting. Maybe she is right,
            we bite and arch our backs. The other cat are very playful, but he is big and strong, I am a little scared of him and try to avoid him.
            Fortunately, my human defends me from him.

        <p>
            I like plaing with my owner and my favorite toy is a candy wrapper from Ferrero Rocher. It looks like a mouse. Mmmmm....
        </p>
        <p>
            My favorite place is my owner's chest. I love lying on her purring and she likes to pet me.
            She also likes to hold me and I like too. Unlike the other cats, I allow my owner to hold me.
            Sam and Mayka protest when she holds them. I can't understand why.
